h1. Momentum

Momentum is a simple time tracking application currently focused on OSX. 
The goal of the application is two-fold:

  * Track the active application whenever you are using your computer
  * Track the focus of six minute time increments for billing purposes 
  
This inherently involves tracking the amount of idle time while any 
application is active. Eventually there will be statistics, reports and
graphs, and possibly modes which allow you to self assign task-masters.

h2. Todo

Currently only the active application is complete. The six minute increment 
interface and statistical analysis has not yet been built. The application 
may eventually be repackaged as a gem and may support a proper daemon mode.

h2. Getting started

Copy the existing config examples for config/database.yml and config/momentum.yml
to their corresponding files. Once complete, run:

  rake db:migrate
  
If you want to run the tests
 
  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test

To run the application execute:
  
  script/momentum

You will not see anything until you switch the front most application. If you 
do not specify verbose: true in the momentum config then you will never see
anything. 
    
h2. Fixes

* No more global variables
* Trapping SIGINT for clean exit
* Rewrite osa so that all variables are collected in the same call (no conflict)
* Add configuration support
